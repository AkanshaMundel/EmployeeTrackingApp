 Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use the **EmployeeTrackingApp** built with React Native using Android Studio:

**Prerequisites:**
1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
2. Android Studio installed with necessary SDKs.
3. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
4. React Native CLI installed globally (`npm install -g react-native-cli`).

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository of the **EmployeeTrackingApp** to your local machine using Git.

   cd EmployeeTrackingApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create Android Emulator:**
   Open Android Studio and create a virtual device (emulator) if you don't have a physical Android device. This emulator will be used to run the React Native app.

4. **Start Metro Server:**
   In the project directory, start the Metro server. This is responsible for bundling the app's JavaScript code.

   ```
   npx react-native start
   ```

5. **Run the App:**
   Open a new terminal window in the project directory and start the app on the emulator.

   ```
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

   This command will build the app and install it on the Android emulator. The app should now be up and running on the emulator.

6. **Testing and Development:**
   You can make changes to the app's codebase and see the updates by saving the changes and then refreshing the app on the emulator by pressing `R` twice or using the "Reload" option.

7. **Troubleshooting:**
   If you encounter any issues during the setup process, refer to the React Native documentation and Android Studio documentation for troubleshooting and solutions.
